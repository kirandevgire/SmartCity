									<h3>Fashion Street</h3>
									<p>Pune’s fashion street, much like the one we have in Mumbai, has a wide array of fashion stalls of clothing and accessories to choose from.
All you fashionistas, the name says it all. The latest, trendy fashion can be found here. Be it a different sling bag for every new dress, or a cute pair of PJs for a sleepover at your bestie’s – you must visit Fashion Street. And yes, just like FC Road, Camp has a lot of eateries to take care of your ‘after shopping hunger pangs’.</p>

									<h3>FC Road</h3>
									<p>Apart from the restaurants, why do you think this place is so hyped? Located in heart of the city, FC Road has local shops that sell trendy footwear and bags. If buying in bulk is what matters to you, FC Road is a must visit. Many vendors come in the evenings with their cart and sell tops, for as cheap as INR 150. Though not very long lasting, they can definitely be used for a few months. Other than shopping, the restaurants on FC Road always welcome you when you wanna grab a quick bite.  
Tip: Avoid weekends, if you hate rush.</p>
